*Probably a less than ideal start, wordpress and plugin version on public display*

*teachers think they are funny*

We also immediately find some hints to possible user logins

Trying to login with a random name gives us the following

![alt text](https://git.fe.up.pt/fsi/fsi2223/l11g03/-/raw/main/imgs/ctf1img4.PNG "Title")

Which suggests the site may give us too much info(it shouldnÂ´t tell us whether an given username exists or not)

As can be seen below, it does gives us too much info

We also find another username but it seems to be unactivated

## Search for a vulnerability

After some search on CVE websites we find one that is very promising.

CVE-2021-34646 states that up to version 5.4.3 of Booster for WooCommerce, which is installed on this instace have an authentication bypass vulnerability via the email verification process
Inserting flag{CVE-2021-34646} on the CTF website confirms we picked the right one

## Search for an exploit

On exploit db we can find a small python script that exploits this weakness and can bypass login with ease

## Running the exploit

Following these instruction we go to http://ctf-fsi.fe.up.pt:5001/wp-json/wp/v2/users and find the user id related to admin

![alt text](https://git.fe.up.pt/fsi/fsi2223/l11g03/-/raw/main/imgs/ctf1img8.PNG "Title")

We run the exploit, giving it the website url and the previously found user id

![alt text](https://git.fe.up.pt/fsi/fsi2223/l11g03/-/raw/main/imgs/ctf1img8.PNG "Title")

We then obtain three links, we click on one

![alt text](https://git.fe.up.pt/fsi/fsi2223/l11g03/-/raw/main/imgs/ctf1img9.PNG "Title")

And we sucessfully bypass authentication and are now logged in as an admin

We then access a private post containing the final flag, flag{please don't bother me}, completing our very first CTF
